Python StudyNotes

Version: 1.0

What this App is?

-An App that allow you to learn and memorize Python piece by piece even when you are in bath room, subway, waiting for bus...

-A pocket reference that you can take out your iPhone, have a peek and immediately know all details that are so hard to remember when you are developing Python programs.


What this App is not?

-Not an App that teaches you with super detailed small steps from scratch : you will need a book for that.

-Not like an encyclopedia with every detail options that make you feel sleepy. The idea is to provide those frequently used knowledge.
